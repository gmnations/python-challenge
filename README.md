# python-challenge
I created a Master and a Main and this was becasue of watching the intro video. I am expecting that the master branch will merge with the main.
We will find out if that is true.

This was a difficult assignment and I needed to consult many recources to feel like I had a basic understanding of the process. I used many code snippits to help. I sent 60% of the hours this week  trying to get the macOS to read the the correct directory. There is an extension in vscode/python that must me selected to make  the directories appear correctly.
